# Local-Solana-Wallet
This is a lightWeight implementation of a Solana Wallet to be run across multiple platforms (MacOs,IOS,Android and potentially web and Win). developed mainly using expo. It should be noted that this is for personal use and should not be trusted with substantial sums of money, no matter how secure the code appears to be.
