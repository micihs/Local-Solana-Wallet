# Local-Solana-Wallet
This is a lightWeight implementation of a Solana Wallet to be run across multiple platforms (MacOs,IOS,Android and potentially web and Win). developed mainly using expo. It should be noted that this is for personal use and should not be trusted as a primary source of wallet key storage, please ensure that the hard coded wallet values have been backed up properly.
